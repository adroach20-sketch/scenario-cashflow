# v1.6 Feedback & Ideas

Captured from Andrew's testing session on 2026-02-24.
Status updated 2026-02-25.

## Loan/Financing Calculator — Done
- When adding a financed expense (e.g., furniture), let user enter: total amount, term (months), interest rate
- Auto-calculate monthly payment from those inputs
- Or give the option to enter a custom monthly payment directly
- Streams must respect end dates — a 3-year loan shouldn't show payments in year 4 of a 10-year forecast
- This is about making it easier to model real-world financing decisions without manual math
- **Implemented:** `src/engine/loan.ts` with `calculateMonthlyPayment()`

## Inline Calculator in Amount Fields — Done
- Amount input fields should support basic math expressions (e.g., `1200+350`, `4200*2`)
- Evaluate on blur or Enter, store the result
- Reduces friction — Andrew was pulling up a separate calculator app to figure out amounts
- **Implemented:** `src/engine/calc.ts` (expression evaluator) + `src/components/CalculatorInput.tsx`

## Decision Panel Redesign — Partially Addressed
- **New streams should be the primary action** — show the "add stream" form up top, with one already open by default
- **Remove balance adjustments** (checking/savings adjustment fields) — these are opaque numbers that don't explain themselves
- Instead, model upfront costs as one-time expense streams (e.g., "$8,000 renovation deposit" on a specific date)
- Everything in a decision becomes a stream, making the model self-documenting
- **Status:** Scenario workflow was flattened from wizard to tabs, but balance adjustment fields may still exist. Needs review.

## Remove Baseline Streams from Decision Panel — Needs Review
- Baseline streams currently show in both the Decision panel (step 1) and the Adjust Streams panel (step 3)
- Remove them from the Decision panel — that step should focus only on what's *new* in the decision
- Stream toggling/overriding already lives in step 3
- **Status:** Wizard steps were replaced with a flat layout. Need to verify whether baseline streams still appear where they shouldn't.

## New Scenario Should Start Ready to Edit — Done
- When creating a new scenario, don't make the user click "What if" to get started
- The worksheet/form should already be open and ready for input
- Reduce the number of clicks to get from "new scenario" to actually entering data
- **Implemented:** `handleNewScenario` in `App.tsx` auto-creates a first decision

## Scenario Switcher UX — Partially Addressed
- Current scenario picker is confusing — Andrew accidentally overwrote a base scenario thinking he was creating a new one
- Needs clearer visual distinction between "you're editing this scenario" vs. "create a new one"
- Consider: more prominent active scenario indicator, confirmation when switching away with unsaved changes, or a different interaction pattern for "new" vs. "switch"
- **Status:** Sidebar redesign with `ScenarioTabs` changed the interaction model. The original confusion about overwriting vs. creating may still need attention — worth testing again.
